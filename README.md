Smart Matrix Headlight

Overview
The Smart Matrix Headlight is an intelligent lighting system designed to enhance visibility and safety by dynamically adjusting LED illumination based on object detection. The system uses Machine Learning (ML) and Arduino to control multiple LEDs covering a 120-degree field of view.

Features
Object Detection – Uses a camera to detect object position in real-time.
Dynamic LED Control – LEDs are activated based on object position to optimize visibility.
120-Degree Coverage – Multiple LEDs collectively cover a wide-angle view.
ML Integration – Machine learning algorithms determine precise LED activation.
Arduino-Based – Hardware implementation using Arduino for LED control.

Tech Stack
Machine Learning: OpenCV, TensorFlow (or alternative)
Hardware: Arduino, Camera Module, LED Array
Programming Languages: Python, C++
